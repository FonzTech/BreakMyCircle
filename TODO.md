# Things to do

- ~~Asset Manager decoupled from game objects.~~
- ~~Make IDrawCallback a callback to receive updates, such as drawable transformations (position, rotation, etc&#8230;).~~
- ~~Create prototype for projectile and collision against other bubbles.~~
- ~~Fix location for new bubbles, when the static positioning places it in an already occupied spot.~~
- ~~Destroy nearby bubbles, with the same color, when one is hit by a projectile.~~
- ~~Make bubble fall, if not supported by one bubble on top, at least.~~
- ~~Add Magnum's resource manager. Fix pending references.~~
- ~~Fix transparency and Z-Ordering problems.~~
- ~~Lambda as shader creation facility for complex drawables.~~
- ~~Animation for player shooter, to make the next ball appear with transition.~~
- Render the bubble-gameplay scene to a separate render target, to avoid clipping and manage scene position independently.
- Scenery to the test room.
- Small main menu for game.
- Level screen with overworld and changing themes.
- Implement pause/resume system for game. And so the pause menu.
- Procedural level generation.
