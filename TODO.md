# Things to do

- ~~Asset Manager decoupled from game objects.~~
- ~~Make IDrawCallback a callback to receive updates, such as drawable transformations (position, rotation, etc&#8230;).~~
- ~~Create prototype for projectile and collision against other bubbles.~~
- Destroy nearby bubbles, with the same color, when one is hit by a projectile.
